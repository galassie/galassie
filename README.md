# Hi there, I'm Enrico Galassi 🐱‍💻

I'm a software engineer and a technologist enthusiast, always thrilled when I can test myself in something new and challenging.

I love to design 📝, analyze 🔍, code 👨🏼‍💻, listen 👂🏼, talk 📣, learn 🧠.

I'm also a traveler 🌏, snowboarder 🏂 and a videogamer 🎮.

Take a look at some of my open source projects 👇🏻
